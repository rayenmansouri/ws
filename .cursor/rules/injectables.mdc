- You should always register the class both [containerRegistry.ts](mdc:src/core/container/containerRegistry.ts) and [container.ts](mdc:src/core/container/container.ts) and follow the organizations there whenever you use the @injecatble() decorator from inversify.
- You don't need to pass generics, the types are already handled
