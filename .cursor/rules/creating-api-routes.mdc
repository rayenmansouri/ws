- when never I ask from you to create api routes you should use this command which already add the boilerplate code for the routes `ws route create -f FEATURE_NAME -u USER_TYPE -p PLATFORM ROUTENAME`
- user type can either be admin, student, parent, teacher, public
- platform either web or mobile.
- you should also update the files generated from the CLI correctly like updating the path, importing the use case and calling it in the controller, ect.
- you should update the files in this order exactly, .validations.ts, .route.ts, .types.ts, .controller.ts
- we always use camelCase for route names.
- you can use git commands in terminal to check the created files by the CLI and their paths
